                    <p>
                        Summer break in 2009, you find yourself standing alone on what appears to be a deserted road, waiting for the bus. Your destination? A peculiar theme park situated high in the mountains. This park is known to be the best in the world, but it strikes you as odd that no one seems to remember how or when it came to be. It's as if it has always existed.<br>
                        <br>
                        Rumors about a vanished ride, two missing people, and strange unexplainable sightings have haunted this amusement park's history for the past decade. Despite these persistent rumors, no one seems to believe in them.<br>
                        <br>
                        However, you have a different plan in mind. You intend to investigate these mysteries and uncover the truth behind them.

                            <p>She's a temp-hire working at The Theme Park, known for her quick-wit, intelligence, and love for coffee. As a roller coaster engineer, she's considered to be one of the best in the business.
                                <br><br>
                                Despite her professionalism, there seems to be something more that she's searching for at The Theme Park.

                                Perhaps it's the excitement of uncovering something new and unexpected, or maybe she's on a personal mission to discover a hidden truth about the park. Whatever the reason, her determination and expertise make her an invaluable asset to the park, and her passion for exploration continues to inspire those around her

                            <p>Tim is the laid-back manager of the ride management team at the park. Known for his easy-going nature and approachable demeanor, he always puts his employees first.
                                <br><br>
                                While he can often be found in the meeting room, handling paperwork and ensuring everything runs smoothly, there's more to Tim than meets the eye. He possesses a wealth of knowledge about the park's history and inner workings, but he doesn't always let on about what he knows.
                                <br><br>
                                Perhaps it's his quiet confidence that allows him to remain level-headed in the face of challenges, or maybe he's just humble about his abilities. Whatever the reason, Tim's dedication to his job and his team make him an indispensable part of the park's operations.

                                Paul is a tired-looking park-goer who was once known for telling tall tales. Though his stories were often dismissed as mere fabrications, rumors persist that he carries a dark secret.
                                <br><br>
                                These days, Paul spends his time quietly at the local cafe. His once-energetic demeanor has been replaced by a sense of weariness, and he often seems lost in thought. Despite his apparent reluctance to share his thoughts and experiences, it's clear that something is weighing heavily on his mind.

                                The circumstances surrounding William's disappearance remain a mystery, and rumors about what might have happened to him continue to circulate among park employees and visitors alike. Some say that he simply wandered off and got lost in the dense forest that surrounds the park, while others believe that it was something more sinister.
                                <br><br>
                                Whatever the truth may be, William's disappearance has left a lasting impression on the park and those who knew him. His absence is felt to this day, and his story serves as a cautionary tale for all who work and visit the park.
